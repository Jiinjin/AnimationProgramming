# AnimationProgramming

## Hardware needed

I personally use Visual Studio 2019 & Cmake 3.16.3 to setup the project

## Setup the project
First of, clone the project wherever you want with the following command :

`git clone https://github.com/Jiinjin/AnimationProgramming.git`

Then open Cmake, and put the project path on the top input text, and the same right under but with `/build` at the end
